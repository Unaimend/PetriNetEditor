#definition("Petri Net*")[
A (finite marked) _Petri Net_ is a tuple $N = (P, T, W, M_0)$ where
 $P$ is the set of _places_, $P = {p_0, dots, p_n}$.

 $T$ is the set of _transitions_, $T = {t_1, dots, t_m}$.

 $W$: $((P times T) union (T times P)) arrow.r.long NN$ is the _weight function_.
 when $W(x,y)$ = k, with $k gt 0$, then net includes an _arc_ from $x$ to $y$ with weight $k$.
 
 $M_0$ is an $n$-dimensional vector of non-negative integers which represents the _initial marking_ of the net.

Let $N = (P, T, W, M_0)$ be a Petri Net. 
We call an element $p in P$ a place.
It is represented as a circle in their respective graphical drawing. Due to the biological context of this document we will use metabolite and place interchangeably.

#definition("Marking*")[
 Let  $N = (P, T, W, M_0)$ be a finite marked petri net with $|P| = n in N$.
 A vector $M = (m_1, dots, m_n) in ZZ^n_(gt.eq 0)$ is called a _marking_. 
A _marking_ M is graphically represented by inserting in each place $p_i$ a corresponding number $m_i$. This number is called the _tokens_ of $p_i$. Sometimes we represent this number as small circles in the place.
We call a marking $M'=(m'_1,dots, m'_n)$ a _cover_ of $M$ if $m_i lt.eq m'_i$ for $i in {1, dots, n}$.
In this case we write $M lt.eq M'$. In the biological context this describes the amount of $m_i$ of specific molecule $p_i$. We will sometimes not draw this information.
]


#definition("Precondition/input bag*")[
Let  $N = (P, T, W, M_0)$ be a finite marked petri net, $t in T$ a transition. The _precondition_  of the transition $t$ is denoted by $t^- = {i_1, dots, i_n} in ZZ^n_(gt.eq 0)$ where $i_j = W(p_j, t)$  for any $j in {1, dots, n}$.
]

#definition("Post-condition/output bag")[
Let  $N = (P, T, W, M_0)$ be a finite marked petri net, $t in T$ a transition.
The _post-condition_  of the transition $t$ is denoted by $t^+ = {o_1, dots, o_n} in ZZ^n_(gt.eq 0)$ where $o_j = W(t, p_j)$  for any $j in {1, dots, n}$.
]

Intuitively, $t^âˆ’$ indicates, for every place of the net, the number of tokens needed to enable transition $t$. The _firing_ of *t* removes such tokens and generates new ones, as indicated by $t^+$.

#definition("Enabled transition, firing*")[
Let $N = (P, T, W, M_0)$ be a Petri Net, $t  in T$ a transition. $t$ is called _enabled_ by the marking $m$ if $t^- lt.eq M$. In this case t can _fire_ and the net marking changes from $M$ to $M'$ as follows $M' = M - t^- + t^+$. We denote  this by $M arrow^t M'$.

= Introduction
Why simulate
What has been done (fba, small petri nets, exissting pieces of software)
Why are we doing its(obj  function eukarytoes)

= Simulation Approaches
Due to the nature of the project and petri nets different approaches can be used to simulate firing.
I have split those into two categories: _local firing approaches_ and _non-local firing_ approaches based on the fact if a transition only needs information about its own places (local) or also information about places from other transitions (non-local).
Another differentiation that can be made concerns the deterministic nature of petri-nets. 
For now we will only discuss local firing approaches. We will first describe a mathematical formulation of firing. This will lead us to synchronous firing approaches. This section is mostly intended as a reference for tried-out approaches and their problems, advantages and disadvantages.

== Mathematical description 
Given a petri net N  = (P, T, W, M_0) we can describe the firing by matrix operations and a control vector $u$ that controls which transitions fire. #todo{what element i u}


#definition("matrix firing")[
  Let $A$ be the incidence matrix from the example given in @cool_example and $u_1$ some control vector. Thus we have 
  #align(center)[
  $A^t =  mat(
   2&,  0&,  0&,  0&, 0&;
  -1&,  2&,  0&,  0&, 0&;
   0&, -3&,  1&,  1&, 0&;
   0&,  2&, -1&,  0&, 0&;
   1&, -1&,  0&, -1&, 1&;
   0&,  0&,  0&,  0&, 2&
) $, $M_0 = mat( 
  0;
  0;
  1;
  1;
  1;
)$ and $u_1 = mat( 
  1;
  0;
  0;
  0;
  0;
)$]]
Thus the first transition fires and we can reach the next state following equation $M_1 = M_0 + A^(t)u_1$. In general we can reach the k-th state with regards to some firing sequence $(u_1, u_2, dots u_k)$ by calculating $M_n = M_0 + A^(t)Sigma_(i=1)^n u_k$.

#example("matrix firing")[
  #align(center)[
    $M_1 = M_0 + A^t  u_1 =
    mat(
      0;

  edge((0,4), (1,3), "-|>"),
  edge((1,1), (2,1), "-|>"),
  edge((1,3), (2,3), "-|>"),
)]] <sync_fire>

Depending on the order in which $t_1$ and $t_2$ are saved in the program, one or the other transition will become _disabled_ after the firing of the other. A naive solution to the ordering-problem would be to check all reactions if they are active given the current amount of tokens.
```js
var enabled = findAllActiveReaction()
for r in (enabled):
  fire(r)
```
This results in a different problem. Given the example above the would result in $t_1$ and $t_2$ both being marked as active. Adhering to the above  this would either fire $t_1$ or $t_2$ first and then the reaction that is left. But this would mean that $P_2$ would be left with a negative amount of tokens (See @bad_fire). Thus checking which transitions are _enabled_ before firing them is either impossible or necessitates a more complex resolution step. Thus we will focus on firing approaches that immediately fire transitions if enabled. As discussed these depend on the order of fired transitions, thus are non-deterministic in the sense that the results depends on internal implementation details. To circumvent this problem we decided to make the simulation truly non-deterministic by permuting the firing order.

Mathematical description of @sync_fire. One can see that a synchronous firing approach results in an inconsistent state.]<bad_fire>

=== Non-deterministic firing
Non-deterministic firing describes an approach where the order in which transitions fire is different each timestep. It is either possible to permute all enabled transitions and fire them,  

```js
var enabled = findAllActiveReaction(reactions)
shuffle(enabled)
fire(enabled)
```
or to just pick a random enabled transition a fire it.
```js
var r = pickRandom(findAllActiveReaction(reactions))
fire(r)
```
When permuting all transitions one could either choose a synchronous approach where a permutation of all active transitions fires or one just fires one transition at a time.
The advantage of this approach is that it is more realistic as certain enzymes have certain possibilities of firing. One disadvantage is that this, of course, necessitates a sampling approach.
This could result in significant runtime costs due to the size of the state space. This discussion so far has beed mostly focussed on the computer science aspect but due to the nature of the project there are additional biological concern that need to be factored in.

=== Stopping criteria

=== Biological concerns
#todo[list a few things that effect the enzyme activation in real life]

==== Concentration Based
  Due physical constraints enzymes usually do not go against the concentration gradient. Thus it would make sense to take the amount of tokens of the incoming and outgoing places of a transition into account. This could be done in synchronous or asynchronous manner. The advantage of this is the more realistic representation of biology. There are several ways this can be achieved, one could implement an probabilistic firing scheme in which the amount of the product and reactant determine the possibility of a transition being fired

==== Non-deterministic gradient-based firing
#figure[
```js
var enabled = findAllActiveReaction(reactions)
shuffle(enabled)
for r in enabled:
  var ic = getInputConcentration(r)
  var oc = getOutputConcentration(r)
  var p = firingProbability(r, ic, oc)
  fire(r, p)
```] <grad>
#todo[what model of enzyme acitivation is used that only depends on concentration]
This immediatly results in a question. How do we determine what the products and reactants of a reactions are? From a biological standpoint this is quite clear, but we were not able to find a simple way of, for example, differentiating between products and cofactors. Imagine the reaction A + ATP -> B + ADP, here the concentration of A and B, and of course presence of ATP, should determine the rate of reaction. But that the concentration of ATP is less relevant than that of A and B is non-obvious to a machine. We were not able to find a database that provides this information. #todo[this should be listed in further improvements]

== Results 
=== Implementation
We will discuss our implementation in detail. We will first give an overview of what our software can do and go into more detail of our simulation approach.

==== Overview
We implemented two different pieces of software. An Editor to create small petri net (see @Editor) and a simulator to execute a given petri net (see @Simulator). To this end we create a separate script that takes in a sbml model and converts it to a json file that can be used by the simulator (See `src/scripts/sbmlToPetri.py` in the Editor). The simulator contains an additional config file where one can define different simulation parameters. 

==== Model conversion

During the project we found out that sbml files contain reactions that have non-integer stoichiometry coefficients. Due to the nature of standard petri nets those could not be represented. To still include those in our project we converted all the coefficients and bounds to integers by following procedures.

```js
coefficients = getNonIntegerCoefficients()
minC = min(abs(coefficients))
exponent = round(math.log10(1 / global_min_coef)) + 1
factor = 10 ** exponent

for r in reactions:
  r.coefficients = r.coefficients * factor
  r.bounds = r.bounds * factor
```
Other than that no changes were needed.

==== Main Simulation loop
The main loop consist of three steps, first we check if we should stop according to one of the above #todo[write them] stopping criteria. If we need to continue we permute the transition, afterwards we loop over all reactions and if enabled fire them. To check if a reaction is enabled we use the above described gradient based approach (See @grad)
