= Definitions
Definitions marked with a \* were adopted from @survey
#definition("Petri Net*")[
A (finite marked) _Petri Net_ is a tuple $N = (P, T, W, M_0)$ where
 $P$ is the set of _places_, $P = {p_0, dots, p_n}$.

 $T$ is the set of _transitions_, $T = {t_1, dots, t_m}$.

 $W$: $((P times T) union (T times P)) arrow.r.long NN$ is the _weight function_.
 when $W(x,y)$ = k, with $k gt 0$, then net includes an _arc_ from $x$ to $y$ with weight $k$.
 
 $M_0$ is an $n$-dimensional vector of non-negative integers which represents the _initial marking_ of the net.

#definition("Place*")[
Let $N = (P, T, W, M_0)$ be a Petri Net. 
We call an element $p in P$ a place.
It is represented as a circle in their respective graphical drawing. Due to the biological context of this document we will use metabolite and place interchangeably.
]

#definition("Transition*")[
Let $N = (P, T, W, M_0)$ be a Petri Net. 
We call an element $t in T$ a transition.
It is represented as a rectangle in their respective graphical drawing. Due to the biological context of this document we will use reaction and place interchangeably. 
]


#definition("Arc*")[
Let $N = (P, T, W, M_0)$ be a Petri Net. 
We call an element $a in ((P times T) union (T times P))$  an arc.
It is represented as an arrow in their respective graphical drawing.
]


#definition("Marking*")[
 Let  $N = (P, T, W, M_0)$ be a finite marked petri net with $|P| = n in N$.
 A vector $M = (m_1, dots, m_n) in ZZ^n_(gt.eq 0)$ is called a _marking_. #todo{Tokens}
A _marking_ M is graphically represented by inserting in each place $p_i$ a corresponding number $m_i$
We call a marking $M'=(m'_1,dots, m'_n)$ a _cover_ of $M$ if $m_i lt.eq m'_i$ for $i in {1, dots, n}$.
In this case we write $M lt.eq M'$. In the biological context this describes the amount of $m_i$ of specific molecule $p_i$. We will sometimes not draw this information.
]


#definition("Precondition/input bag*")[
Let  $N = (P, T, W, M_0)$ be a finite marked petri net, $t in T$ a transition. The _precondition_  of the transition $t$ is denoted by $t^- = {i_1, dots, i_n} in ZZ^n_(gt.eq 0)$ where $i_j = W(p_j, t)$  for any $j in {1, dots, n}$.
]

#definition("Post-condition/output bag")[
Let  $N = (P, T, W, M_0)$ be a finite marked petri net, $t in T$ a transition.
The _post-condition_  of the transition $t$ is denoted by $t^+ = {o_1, dots, o_n} in ZZ^n_(gt.eq 0)$ where $o_j = W(t, p_j)$  for any $j in {1, dots, n}$.
]

Intuitively, $t^âˆ’$ indicates, for every place of the net, the number of tokens needed to enable transition $t$. The _firing_ of *t* removes such tokens and generates new ones, as indicated by $t^+$.

= Simulation Approaches
Due to the nature of the project and petri nets different approaches can be used to simulate firing.
I have split those into two categories: _local firing approaches_ and _non-local firing_ approaches based on the fact if a transition only needs information about its own places (local) or also information about places from other transitions (non-local). For now we will only discuss local firing approaches. This section is mostly intended as a reference for tried-out approaches and their problems, advantages and disadvantages.

== Mathematical description 
Given a petri net N  = (P, T, W, M_0) we can describe the firing by matrix operations and a control vector $u$ that controls which transitions fire. #todo{what element i u}

#definition("matrix firing")[
  Let $A$ be the incidence matrix from the example given in #todo{add ref} and $u_1$ some control vector. Thus we have 
  #align(center)[
  $A =  mat(
   2&,  0&,  0&,  0&, 0&;
  -1&,  2&,  0&,  0&, 0&;
   0&, -3&,  1&,  1&, 0&;
   0&,  2&, -1&,  0&, 0&;
   1&, -1&,  0&, -1&, 1&;
   0&,  0&,  0&,  0&, 2&
) $, $M_0 = mat( 
  0;
  0;
  1;
  1;
  1;
)$ and $u_1 = mat( 
  1;
  0;
  0;
  0;
  0;
)$]
Thus the first transition fires and we can reach the next state band y following equation $M_1 = M_0 + A^(t)u_1$. In general we can reach the k-th state with regards to some firing sequence $(u_1, u_2, dots u_k)$ by calculating $M_k = M_0 + A^(t)u_k$.

]

== Local firing approaches

=== Synchronous firing
The synchronous firing approach tries to fire all enabled transitions at the same time.
```js
var enabled = findAllActiveReaction()
fire(enabled)
```
  This results in an ordering-problem. The results of some firings will be dependend one implementation of how the `enabled` list is being filed. #todo{word} following example.
